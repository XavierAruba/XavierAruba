- 👋 Hi, I’m @XavierAruba
- 👀 I’m interested in building ERP's.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning relational databases on freecodecamp.org
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I've built ERP's using FileMaker for sign companies, outdoor advertising agencies and I'm currently working on one for my local gym.
